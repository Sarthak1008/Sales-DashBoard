# Sales-DashBoard
This is dynamic Sales dashboard made using SpringBoot and React

The project dynamic sales dashboard is a web application developed using the Spring Boot framework for the backend and React with Material UI for the frontend. The dashboard allows users to view and analyze sales data in real-time.

The Material UI was used to create a basic template for the dashboard interface with a modern look and feel. The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) elements were implemented using Spring Boot's RESTful API and Axios, which is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests from the frontend.

The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to manage sales data and allows users to perform various actions such as adding new sales data, updating existing data, deleting data, and viewing sales reports with interactive charts and graphs.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of combining Spring Boot with React and Material UI to create a dynamic and responsive dashboard application that can handle complex data operations.
